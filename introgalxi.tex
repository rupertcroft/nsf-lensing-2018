\section{Introduction to Lensing-induced Anisotropies (LIA) 
of galaxy clustering}\label{sec:lia}

\subsection{Motivation}

\subsubsection{The Effect}
Some regions in the universe are more overdense than
others.  This means that light passing through one direction is
distorted in ways different than is light traversing another line of
sight. This simple fact has dramatic implications for the
correlations between galaxies. The simplest statistic that
characterizes the angular distribution of galaxies on the sky is the
angular correlation function, $w(\vec\theta_1,\vec\theta_2)$, which
quantifies the excess probability over random that a galaxy will be
found at $\vec\theta_2$ given that there is a galaxy at
$\vec\theta_1$. It is usually argued that there is no special place in
the universe, so this excess probability does not depend on the
locations $\vec\theta_1$ and $\vec\theta_2$ separately but rather on
their difference, $\vec\theta_1-\vec\theta_2$. Further, since the
deviations from uniformity are not expected to have a special
direction, the angular correlation function is assumed to depend only
on the angular distance between galaxies, $\vert\vec\theta_!-\vec\theta_2\vert$.

This assumption breaks down in the real universe where different lines
of sight pass through over- or under-dense regions. The observed
angular correlation therefore depends on the angular positions of the
two galaxies: $w=w(\vec\theta_1 ,\vec\theta_2)\ne
w(\vert\vec\theta_1-\vec\theta_2\vert)$. We propose to use this {\it
  anisotropy of the correlation function} to learn about the structure
between us and the background galaxies. We will first detect this
behind the most massive objects, galaxy clusters, and then move to
measure the anisotropy on the full sky, where it is induced by the
various under- and over-dense regions that constitute the cosmic
web. To be clear, the variety of non-gaussian effects that impact the
distribution of galaxies on the sky do {\it not} break isotropy so
cannot be confused with this effect.

{\it Galaxy clusters and the acceleration of the universe:} Galaxy
clusters are the largest, most massive bound structures in the
universe and therefore are the key to a number of cosmological
puzzles. Chief among these is identifying the mechanism responsible
for the current epoch of cosmic acceleration. The community has moved
on from simply measuring the equation of state of a hypothetical dark
energy substance. There is now a concerted effort to test the
canonical $ \Lambda$CDM predictions both for the expansion history of
the universe and for the rate of the growth of structure. Galaxy
clusters offer the potential for testing both of these predictions:
the number of rare objects such as clusters at a given time is
exponentially sensitive to the RMS fluctuations in the density field,
so cluster abundance at multiple redshifts can be translated into measurements of the growth function. Similarly, the abundance is
sensitive to the volume of a given redshift slice, which depends on
the redshift-distance relation.

The one impediment to date of using clusters as a powerful tool is the
uncertainty in cluster masses. However, we are entering an exciting
epoch that promises to change this situation. Besides the large
surveys now online and coming online in the 2020's, five ways of
inferring cluster masses have emerged and using all of them together
leads to the hope that the systematic uncertainties in any one of them
will not induce a large bias. The techniques of interest are: cluster
richness, X-Ray luminosity, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal induced by hot
electrons in the intracluster gas, weak lensing by galaxies, and most
recently weak lensing by the cosmic microwave background 
(CMB)~\cite{Liu:2014pqa,Baxter:2014frs,2014MNRAS.439.1628Z,melchior2017,simet2017,Baxter:2017ixz}. This
proposal aims to add yet another tool that can measure galaxy cluster
masses.

\subsubsection{Context}

Of course, using the anisotropy in clustering
statistics has been exploited already in studies of the cosmic
microwave background.  The small scale structure of the CMB carries
information about the lensing potential along the line of sight. This
information has now been extracted by multiple CMB experiments,
obtaining maps of the integrated gravitational potential and
information about the masses of clusters. There are differences
between the lensing-induced anisotropies proposed here and those
produced by lensing of the CMB. First, the information in the CMB is
currently limited by the resolution of the telescopes to be about
$1'$, while galaxy surveys that measure galaxies do much better,
resolving galaxies separated by several arcseconds. Second, the
primary CMB is predominantly a Gaussian field, while the small scale
galaxy distribution has evolved to be very non-gaussian\footnote{A
  technical point: the impact of lensing produces an anisotropic field
  in both the cases of the CMB and galaxy clustering. In the former
  case, the anisotropic field is Gaussian, while in the latter it is
  non-gaussian. In both cases, though, the effect is characterized by
  $w\ne w(\vert\vec\theta_1-\vec\theta_2\vert)$.  The distinction between the Gaussian (CMB) and non-Gaussian (galaxies) manifestations
  of lensing disappears when one considers the power spectra of the
  lensing field: these are estimated via a 4-point function, which is
  non-gaussian in both cases.}.

The difference in scales suggests that the route into this new effect
of the clustering anisotropy induced by lensing is by first detecting
it when the lenses are discrete objects such as clusters. Upcoming
surveys will find hundreds of galaxies -- and therefore tens of
thousands of pairs of galaxies -- in the few square arcminute field
behind a galaxy cluster. As we show below, this leads to an exciting
opportunity to open up this new area of lensing. The fact that the
signal scales with the number of pairs of galaxies and the fact that
the shapes of these galaxies do not need to be measured reflect two
advantages over the current weak lensing estimates of cluster
masses. After detecting this effect behind clusters, we will turn to
large scale mapping of the integrated gravitational potential. Here,
the problem becomes similar to the CMB because the galaxy field on
large scales is close to gaussian, so many of the tools developed in
CMB lensing can be imported. Indeed, cross-correlating the maps
produced by the CMB and those produced by galaxy fields will be a
powerful way to reduce the systematic effects that afflict each
separately.




\subsection{Estimates of detectability}

Let us provide a rough estimate of the detectability of
lensing-induced anisotropy in the galaxy distribution. Consider many
galaxies behind a massive galaxy cluster, with a known correlation
function $w(\theta)$. This assumption is important, but it is also
completely realistic because we will be able to measure the
correlation function over an entire survey so will have millions of
regions of roughly the size we are considering (ten square
arcminutes). When we average $w$ over all these regions, we will
obtain an excellent estimate of it on arcminute scales. The observed
correlation function will be distorted due to the presence of the
foreground lens, as in the cartoon in Fig.~\ref{cluster}. Each
galaxy's position will be shifted: \be \vec\theta^{\rm obs} =
\vec\theta + \vec{\delta\theta}(\vec\theta) \ee where $\vec\theta$ is
the undeflected positions, and the deflection angle $\vec
{\delta\theta}$ is a function of $\vec\theta$ that depends on the mass
distribution of the lens. In the simplest example of a point mass
lens, \be \vec{\delta\theta}(\vec\theta) =
\vec\theta\,\frac{\theta_E^2}{\theta^2} \ee where $\theta_E$ is the
Einstein radius of the lens, which could be as large as $1'$ for a
very massive cluster.





\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.33]{figs/clusterfig.jpg}
  \end{center}
  \caption{
{\bf Cartoon of the impact of a foreground lens on
  background galaxies.} All galaxies appear further away from the
  cluster center, their observed positions shifting as
  indicated by the arrows. Galaxies closest to the center experience
  the largest shift in position (this 
lensing deflection is not shown to scale). The correlation function
of the background galaxies will also be distorted by these deflection
angles, and this is what we plan to measure.}
  \label{cluster}
\end{figure}

The unlensed positions are $\vec\theta^{\rm obs}-\vec{\delta\theta}$,
and the correlation function governing those unlensed positions is
$w(\theta)$. Therefore, the observed angular correlation function
between two positions $\vec\theta_ i$ and $\vec\theta_j$ is \be w^{\rm
  obs}(\vec\theta_i^{\rm obs},\vec\theta_j^{\rm obs}) = w(\vert
\vec\theta _i^{\rm obs} - \vec{\delta\theta}(\vec\theta_i) -
\vec\theta_j^{\rm obs} + \vec {\delta\theta}(\vec\theta_j)\vert).  \ee
For the purposes of estimating the magnitude of this effect, we now
make the approximation that the deflections are small, so the
argument of $w$ on the right -hand side can be Taylor expanded. Note
that this approximation is not essential, as in the case of CMB
cluster lensing~\cite{Baxter:2014frs} we avoided it by using a likelihood approach, but
this will be the first step in our program. Taylor expanding and dropping the $^{\rm obs}$ superscript on the angles leads to \bea
w^{\rm obs}(\vec\theta_i,\vec\theta_j) &=& w(\theta_{ij}) +
w'(\theta_{ij})\left[ \vec{\delta\theta}(\vec\theta_i) -
\vec{\delta\theta}(\vec\theta_j) \right]\cdot
\frac{\vec\theta_i-\vec\theta_j}{\vert
  \vec\theta_i-\vec\theta_j\vert}\vs &\equiv &w(\theta_{ij}) +
w'(\theta_{ij}) f_{ij} \eql{taylor} \eea where here $\theta_{ij}\equiv
\vert\vec\theta_i-\vec\theta_j\vert$; $w'\equiv d w/d\theta$, which
can be measured extremely accurately from all other patches in the
survey; and the second line condenses the additional terms to save
space.


The second term in \ec{taylor} is the effect we are after, the signal,
as it contains the information about the deflection angles that
depend on the mass of the lens. To estimate the signal to noise, we
imagine pixelizing the region around the lens and forming an
estimator for the angular correlation function for every pixel pair:
\be \hat w(\vec\theta_i,\vec\theta_j) = \delta_i\delta_j \ee where
$\delta_i\equiv (n_i-\bar n)/\bar n$. Here $n_i$ is the number of
galaxie s in pixel $i$ and for simplicity it is assumed that the
expected number of gal axies in each pixel is equal to $n$ (i.e., it
is assumed that the mask is trivi al). This estimator for $w$ is the
Landy and Szalay estimator~\cite{1993ApJ...412...64L}, with an expectation value equal to
\ec{taylor}.  As a first estimate, we neglect cosmic variance, so
that the error on the estimator is simply Poisson noise: \be {\rm
  Var}(\hat w) = \frac{1}{\bar n^2} .\ee The signal to noise squared
then is \be \left(\frac{S}{N}\right)^2 = \sum_{ij}
\frac{\left(w'(\theta_{ij})f_{ij}\right )^2}{1/\bar n^2} \ee
Fig.~\rf{fthij} shows $f_{ij}/\theta_{ij}$ ( which multiplies
$dw/d\ln(\theta)$ in the sum for all pairs of pixels. Of course pixels
closest to the center of the cluster contribute the most to the signal
to noise.

\Sfig{figs/fthij}{Contribution to the signal to noise on the
  lensing-induced anisotropy from pairs of pixels as a function of
  the distance of the first pixel to the center. Here the cluster is
  taken to have an Einstein radius of $0.5'$, and a square region of
  $50$ square arcmin is used in the sum, with 169 pixels covering the
  area.}

In the example depicted in the figure, the total signal to noise is
equal to \be \frac{S}{N} = 0.02 \frac{\bar n}{{\rm gal}/(1')^2}
\,\frac{dw/d\ln(\theta)}{10^ {-2}}.  .\ee Even for the Dark Energy
Survey, which can capture ten galaxies per square arcminute (recall that
shapes are not needed), this estimate for the signal to noise for a single cluster is
0.2. Therefore, stacking 1000 clusters will give a 6-sigma
detection. And upcoming surveys with the capability to go much deeper
will do considerably better, perhaps even detecting the effect on a
single massive cluster.

Of course this estimate needs to be fleshed out and tested on simulations; 
indeed, this is the main aim of a large part of the proposal (\S\ref{sec:sim}).
