\section{Project management and timeline}
The projects will be carried out by two graduate students (one
supported jointly by the grant an a TA position), 
the two PI/Co-PI faculty
members, outreach coordinator Turnshek, and undergraduate researchers.

\noindent{\bf Year 1}.  In the first year, the initial mock
datasets will be generated, both sources and lenses.
The PI and a graduate student
will coordinate and will be responsible for the 
forest lensing sources, the Co-I  and other graduate student will
work on the  galaxy source field and time delay estimators.
 Both graduate students and undergraduates will combine these
with the lens fields. The PI and Co-I  and graduate students will
work on estimators, and start on first detections from CLAMATO an
a subsample of DES clusters. Turnshek will write the Minecraft lesson
plans, build the worlds with the 
PI and grad students and test them on local schools with UG students. 

\noindent{\bf Year 2}:
The graduate
student will lead a study of systematic selection and 
instrumental effects in the galaxy and forest
mocks. The PI will assemble a dataset drawn from
all SDSS eBOSS spectra taken up to that point, and start
scaling up the estimator code to handle millions of sightlines .
  The Co-I, graduate student and undergraduates will investigate
the predictions for clustering statistics from the mocks
and the potential for cosmological constraints. 
Turnshek will initiate the Universe Sandbox lesson plans with
grad students and the PI and Co-I.
 

\noindent{\bf Year  3}: 
The PI and graduate student will make precise measurements of
the matter power spectrum from \lya\ lensing in the eBOSS
data.The Co-I will make  determinations of cluster masses
from the up-to-date DES data. Both PI and Co-I and  students
will evalulate cosmological constraints.
Turnshek will evaluate the success of
 the lesson plans and prepare them for wider distribution.
