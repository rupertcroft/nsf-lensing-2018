\section{Results from prior NSF support}

PI Croft is the PI of NSF award AST-1412966 (\$593K, 07/14-06/18
including no-cost extension), titled ``Gravitational redshifts of
galaxy clusters and large-scale structure: New probes of modified
gravity and dark matter''.  The project seeks to transform the study
of gravitational redshifts and their associated redshift distortions
into a major branch of cosmology.  {\it Intellectual merit:} The
results of the project so far are (1) making theoretical predictions
for modified gravity and dark matter models and the effects of other
asymmetric redshift distortions.  (2) Formulating optimal statistical
estimators to measure gravitational redshifts in galaxy clusters and
from large-scale structure.  (3) Making the first detection of
pairwise gravitational redshifts from large-scale structure. (4)
Making competitive constraints on deviations from General Relativity
by combining the observational measurements and comparing to model
predictions. These have been published as seven articles so far
\citep{2015MNRAS.453.1754A,2017MNRAS.471.2345Z,2017MNRAS.471.2077A,2017MNRAS.470.2822A,2017arXiv170907854G,2017MNRAS.465.4853A,2016MNRAS.456.3743A}. {\it
  Broader Impacts:} Apart from a total of 7 outreach presentations to
Middle School students, the White House Frontiers Conference and the
Allegheny observatory carried out so far, the main broad impact of the
project will be through the dissemination of a Cosmology video
game. Six undergraduate students have worked on this part of the
project so far.  The best outreach program should be able to easily
reach women and minority groups underrepresented in science. Video
games provide a good way to do just that- a study from the Pew
Internet \& American Life Project (Lenhart 2008) found that the
percentage of American youth that play video games is almost the same
for a wide range of racial and ethnic groups and incomes.  The game
will introduce this audience to concepts in Physics and Cosmology,
including dark matter, inflation, and the formation of cosmic
structure.


Co-I Scott Dodelson was co-I of NSF PHY-1125897: ``Physics Frontier Center at KICP'', and Award of \$22M spanning 2011--2017.
{\it Intellectual merit}
While supported by the Physics Frontier Center proposal, Dodelson
wrote 72 papers. Three of them are particularly relevant to this
proposal. First, he and student Eric Baxter led the effort to detect
CMB lensing around galaxy clusters using data from the South Pole
Telescope~\cite{Baxter:2014frs}. This 3-sigma detection set the stage
for CMB cluster lensing emerging as one of the key elements in the
proposal for CMB-S4 and more recently to yet another detection~\cite{Baxter:2017ixz}, this one using clusters found by the Dark Energy
Survey (DES).  The first detection using a likelihood formalism and
the second a quadratic estimator. These are two of the techniques
that will prove useful in the current proposal's aim to measure
lensing-induced anisotropy in the galaxy correlation function.
A second important thrust was to carry out one of the first 
{\it  de-lensing} studies of CMB
polarization~\cite{Manzotti:2017net}. Lensing of the CMB is a 
phenomenon closely related to lensing-induced anisotropy of the galaxy
correlation function, so understanding the broader context will help
this proposal. 
Finally, Dodelson recently led the analysis that combined probes in
the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to produce the most constraining results
yet from cosmic structure~\cite{Abbott:2017wau}. This effort is one
of the first of a new breed of cosmological analyses, where multiple
probes are combined; we expect the same sort of synergy between the
new probe proposed here and other existing probes.
{\it Broader impacts} Dodelson was involved in the KICP outreach
activities over the lifetime of the grant, which involved     
Cosmology Short Courses - pioneering professional development for museum 
and planetarium staff designed to help bring current research into the 
museum and classroom.
 Museum Partnerships - collaborations with museums to create 
exhibits, shows, and programming that share cosmological research with 
broad and diverse audiences.
 Space Explorers - multifaceted, multi-year commitments
to inner city, minority, precollege students that included
 laboratory experiences, 
and residential science institutes at Yerkes Observatory
